#Playing-With-Matches

This is the same project except here I am using a classList approach to add a 
highlight to the css. Whereas on other projects I was changing styles using 
getElementById. 
Here I am highliting only the matches that are found only on rows. I did not
do the collumns and diagonals becase i realized that it would require the
same code. It is possible but it is a tedious process. 
On the file "script2.js" I am using a for loop to avoid repeating the same 
code. I need help here.
