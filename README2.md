Playing With Matches (For loop attempt)

This is another Playing-With-Matches project where I am trying to compare 
matching numbers with a for loop. My goal is to shorten the code as much 
as possible and find the effective way in doing so using a for loop.
The file "script2.js" has a code where I have implemented the 2 for loops
that will go through the list and compare the indicies. If they are the same
then then I want to use the number of those indicies and use them in a 
function that will return the class name of the div that they are matching at.
This is where i get lost. I need help here. If anyone is able to use what I 
have so far and make my goal a success then please, help me out.
If there is a much more better and/ or easier way then you can modify the code.
 I would prefere it more if it used a for loop.
